Recreation of a 1957 computer business game created at RAND Corp.

Game as described in https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/papers/2007/P1056.pdf
	...and https://sci-hub.do/10.2307/167246

The original version used paper forms and an IBM mainframe to run a math model and tabulate results. This remake uses the same math model, but a web interface to host games online. Currently in a barely-usable state.
